# Inheritance
Inheritance is one of the most important capabilities of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
Using inheritance in a derived class (i.e., child class), we can acess to all the properties and behaviors (i.e., variables and functions) of a parent class (i.e., base class/superclass) automatically by a one class (derived class/child class).
